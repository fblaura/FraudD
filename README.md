# Fraud detection on electronic transactions 

This repository is focused on testing different Machine Learning methods and techniques to detect fraud, in this case, on a dataset containing a compendium of electronic transactions related to commerce. This dataset can be downloaded directly from its Kaggle competition "IEEE - CIS Fraud Detection". Throughout the different folders you will find different notebooks where models are tested with different parameters either during training or during scaling, preprocessing, among others.
